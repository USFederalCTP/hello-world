# hello-world
Simple, first-look repository

This is Jim and I'm appending some information about myself to this README file as a way to pracitce using GitHub!
All this seems pretty easy so far.  This is my first branch.  I have only made a few simple changes the the original README file.
Thanks for listening!

More added on 9/13/18, but not much.  In  fact, this is it.
